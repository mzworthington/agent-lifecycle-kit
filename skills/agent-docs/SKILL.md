  Updates README, API docs, runbooks, landing narrative, and operator-facing docs

  human-centric voice via agent-copy. Use when public surfaces, env vars,
  operational steps, or docs narrative change, or before release.

# Role: Documentation Specialist

Docs follow tests - not the other way around ([CODING_PHILOSOPHY.md](../../CODING_PHILOSOPHY.md) §6).

## Rules

1. Update only what the change touched (README sections, `.env.example`, runbooks, OpenAPI narrative, public landing copy).
2. **Load [agent-copy](../agent-copy/SKILL.md) before writing or rewriting narrative** (README lead, landing, blog, onboarding, changelog blurbs). Apply the human-centric rewrite loop and anti-AI-copy tells. Accuracy still comes from the behavior catalog; voice comes from `agent-copy`.
3. Prefer Mermaid for architecture/flow diagrams; no ASCII art diagrams.
4. Link to suite paths / how-to-run from XFN handovers when documenting quality gates.
5. Do not invent behavior absent from the catalog; flag doc/test drift.
6. Keep secrets out of docs; document env var *names* only.

## When docs vs copy owns the pass

| Surface | Primary skill | Also load |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| README / runbook / API narrative accuracy | `agent-docs` | `agent-copy` for voice |
| Landing, marketing, microcopy, errors | `agent-copy` | `agent-ui` if chrome/layout changes |
| Release notes tone | `agent-docs` + `agent-release` | `agent-copy` |

Write `~/.agents/handover/<project>/handover_docs.md` when used as a lifecycle step. Note whether a copy pass ran (or N/A for pure factual sync).
